=========

**phpwcms** is a flexible, fast, robust, customer and developer friendly
but yet powerful web based content management system and cms framework running
under PHP and MySQL/MariaDB. phpwcms is created and maintained by
[Oliver Georgi](http://twitter.com/slackero). None of the fancy systems but working since more 
than 20 years! Yeah!

Version 1.9.38 is the legacy version of **phpwcms** (version > 1.9.36 and < 1.10).
I will try to keep this on par as long as possible to the newest version
of **phpwcms** v1.10+ â€” if you can try to upgrade existing installations.

To get started, checkout [phpwcms.org](https://www.phpwcms.org) or the community driven
[HowTo Wiki](https://wiki.phpwcms.org/) (snapshot). Most questions are yet
answered on the [phpwcms support forum](https://forum.phpwcms.org).


Quick start
-----------

Stable releases can be used by cloning the repository, `git clone git://github.com/slackero/phpwcms.git` or
[download the archive](https://github.com/slackero/phpwcms/releases).

To start with the latest development version use `git clone -b v1.10-dev git://github.com/slackero/phpwcms.git` or
[download the archive](https://github.com/slackero/phpwcms/archive/refs/heads/v1.10-dev.zip).
If you have downloaded the archive instead of `git clone`, unarchive and copy the files to your web document
root or sub folder. Link your browser to the related URL and follow the install instructions.


Server system requirements
--------------------------

**phpwcms** version 1.9.38 requires a web server with PHP 7.4 or newer.
and a MySQL/MariaDB database (minimum version 5.1, recommend 5.5+).
Always check the [supported versions of PHP](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).


Known problems
--------------

Because of the project history there are several probable problems regarding the database. 
MySQL changed the time and date related default values over the last years. Check to setup
the related config values to connect to the database in a more compatible way. MySQL Strict
is no good option for **phpwcms** < 1.10. But **phpwcms** has a db related
[config setting](https://github.com/slackero/phpwcms/blob/master/include/config/dist.conf.inc.php#L25) 
to force MySQL into a more lax mode.
